    In our faith, we don’t adhere to one specific sacred text or scripture. Instead, we embrace wisdom from all corners of the world, drawing from the teachings and writings of religious, spiritual, and non-religious traditions. We believe that every path—whether rooted in a particular belief system, philosophy, or even no spirituality at all—can offer valuable insights into our shared mission of love, kindness, and transformation.
Our sacred “texts” are a living collection of teachings, stories, and wisdom from diverse sources: sacred scriptures, philosophical works, poetry, scientific discoveries, and personal experiences. We believe that no one text or ideology holds the absolute truth, but together, they guide us toward deeper understanding, compassion, and a more harmonious world.
We encourage everyone—whether devoutly spiritual or completely secular—to bring their unique perspectives and insights into the community. Atheists, agnostics, and followers of any faith are all welcome, as we recognize the beauty in diversity and the importance of mutual respect. Our tradition is one of inclusivity, where all forms of truth and wisdom are honored, and where the ultimate goal is a world built on love, openness, and mutual understanding.
