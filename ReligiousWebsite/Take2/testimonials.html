            <p><b><i>What is the social structure of Evolism?</i></b></p>
            <p>In this structure, there is no formal hierarchy or leadership positions. Instead, Evolites operate as a collective, with all members equally valued and empowered to contribute. Decisions are made through consensus or democratic processes, meaning everyone has an equal say. Instead of assigned roles, individuals take on responsibilities based on their passions, skills, or needs of the community (e.g., ritual facilitators, gardeners, cooks, mediators). Everyoneâ€™s voice matters equally, and the emphasis is on shared leadership. The focus is on individual empowerment and collective evolution.</p>
<p><b><i>Why it works for Evolism: </i></b></p>
<p>This model reflects the belief that all members are divine, and each has unique contributions to make toward the collective good. It fosters a strong sense of personal freedom and responsibility, in line with the values of love, openness, and evolution.</p>
