<b>Who am I?</b>
<p>In our faith, you are a survivor of the cosmic event that marked the end of the world as we knew it. You are part of the chosen few, the ones left to fulfill a unique and sacred role on Earth. Your identity is not defined by the past world’s rules or expectations, but by your ability to embrace love, kindness, and the power of transformation. You are a being with infinite potential, capable of creating paradise on Earth through your actions, communication, and relationships.</p>

<p>
<b>Why am I here?</b>
</p>
<p>
Your purpose in life is clear: you are here to help turn Earth into a paradise. The world was reshaped in the moment the Hadron Collider turned on, and now it is our responsibility to rebuild it with love, compassion, and openness. We are tasked with spreading kindness, healing, and positivity in every interaction, fostering deep and honest connections with others, and contributing to the transformation of the world into a more harmonious place. There is no need to earn your way into a higher existence; your purpose is to create heaven on Earth through the way you live and love.
</p>
<p>
<b>How should I live?</b>
</p>
<p>
You should live with openness, honesty, and compassion. The core values of our faith are centered on love, communication, and kindness. We believe that the key to building a better world is through mutual respect and transparency in all our relationships. While polyamory is embraced by many within our community as a form of expressing unconditional love, it is not a requirement of the faith—what matters most is the authenticity and depth of your relationships, whether romantic, familial, or platonic. Ethical living is about creating an environment where love flourishes and everyone has the opportunity to thrive in peace.
</p>
<p><b>
What happens when I die?</b>
</p>
<p>
When you die, you return to the cosmic flow of energy from which you came. There is no traditional afterlife or reincarnation in our faith; instead, the focus is on your legacy here on Earth. The impact you leave, the love you spread, and the paradise you help create continue to echo long after you are gone. While physical death may come, your spiritual essence becomes a part of the ongoing transformation of the world. You are always part of the greater collective consciousness, contributing to the ongoing creation of heaven on Earth, whether as a memory in the hearts of others or through the ripple effects of your acts of kindness.
