        <p><b><i>Full Moon Ritual (Monthly)</i></b></p>
           <p> <b>Purpose:</b> to honor the cycles of the moon, release what no longer serves s, and set intentions for the coming month.
            <p> <b>Ritual:</b> On the night of the full moon, Evolites gather in the garden or an open natural space, surrounded by the glow of the moon. The ceremony begins with a moment of silence, allowing each individual to reflect on the past month—what they’ve learned, what they’ve let go of, and what they wish to release. People are encouraged to speak aloud or in silence about what no longer serves them and what they want to leave behind.</p>
        	<p><b>Release:</b>  Each participant may write down or say aloud something they wish to release (fears, old habits, negative thoughts) and either burn it in a fire, bury it in the earth, or let it go in some symbolic way.</p>
            <p><b>Intentions:</b> After releasing, participants can set new intentions for the month ahead—goals, aspirations, or positive changes they wish to manifest.</p>
            <b>Prayer:</b> The prayer is flexible and personal. Some may choose to speak their own, while others may prefer silence. Examples could include:</p>
            “Under the light of the moon, I release all that holds me back and welcome new growth.”
            “May this full moon bring clarity to my path and peace to my heart.”
            “I trust in the cycles of nature, and with them, I renew my purpose.”</p>
            <p><b> Nature Element:</b> The full moon itself is the central symbol, connecting each Evolite to the natural world. The ceremony can take place outdoors, where participants may sit or stand in a circle, illuminated by the moon’s light.

<p><b><i>Seasonal Change Ritual (Quarterly)</i></b></p>
<p><b>Purpose:</b> To mark the transition between seasons, honoring the cycles of the Earth and renewing personal communal intentions.</p>
<p><b>Ritual:</b> At the start of each season, Evolites gather in the garden or outdoors to acknowledge the changes in nature and how they mirror our own internal transformations. The ritual is an opportunity to reflect on the lessons learned in the past season and to offer gratitude for the Earth’s cyclical renewal. </p>
<p><b>Reflection and Gratitude:</b> The ceremony begins with a collective reflection on the past season, where each person shares something they’re grateful for or a lesson they’ve learned. Afterward, everyone may participate in planting a new flower, tree, or herb to symbolize personal growth, change, and renewal for the upcoming season.</p>
<p><b> Sharing:</b> Those present may exchange small gifts or symbolic tokens of nature (such as leaves, stones, or flowers), signifying unity and shared growth.</p>
<p><b>Prayer:</b> The prayer or affirmation can be open-ended. Examples could include: 
“With this season, I grow in wisdom, love, and strength.”
“As the Earth transforms, so do I – may I embrace the changes to come.”
“May we, like the seasons, evolve together in harmony and peace.”</p>
<p><b>Nature Element:</b> The planting of a tree, plant, or herb ties the ritual directly to the cycles of nature. Participants may dig, plant, water, or nurture the garden, reinforcing the concept of ongoing growth.</p>
